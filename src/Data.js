     summary: ['My Name is Alexander Ocsa. I am a Computer Scientist and a Software Specialist. I have an M.Cs. and PhD in Computer Science,  with public congratulations (Summa cum laude), the first one from the Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação (ICMC) at the University of São Paulo (USP),  and the second one from  Universidad Nacional de San Agustin (UNSA), Peru. I hold a Professional Title, with public congratulations (Summa cum laude), and a B.Sc. degree  in Systems Engineering (First Position Ranking and with Major in Computer Science) UNSA, Peru.', 'After my M.Cs studies I have  spent a year working  on a owned project creating the first feature-length, interactive Peruvian digital comic book. The Legend of the Incas. It was presented at TEC (www.tec.com.pe) in national television. That was one of the first innovation projects in iOS ecosystem developed in Peru which also was presented in the ComicCon in San Diego (2013).', 'After that, as a part of my preparation during my PhD studies (2014-2017),  I was a partial-time professor for  Universidad Catolica San Pablo, Universidad Nacional de San Agustin (UNSA), Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas. During my days at UNSA University, as a technology innovation consultant I helped to win fundings for research projects for more than 2 millions soles. That allowed me to be part of the Research group of \textit{Large Scale Data Mining to support Researches on Climate Changes} working with Professor Cristian Lopez del Alamo where I spent a couple of years (2015-2016). Professor Cristian was also my advisor during my PhD studies. The last year of my PhD I did an internship at NWES Inc in Toronto Canada as a part of my research.', 'As a part of my professional life, I am currently working at BlazingDB Inc as Senior Software Engineer, I focused my work on  system programming (hardware-level programming, memory management, performance-oriented programming, socket level programming and efficient inter-process communication  for distributed systems) for  next generation of GPU Analytics Tools and machine learning. Additionally, I worked with Hadoop and Spark ecosystems focused on  deploying real world cases solutions for a broad range of AI-based applications on distributed contexts.  Previously, I focused my job for a year on being part of  non-profit organization, I was blessed to work for Laboratoria as a mentor, teacher in the bootcamp and as a senior software engineer to develop the talent and e-learning platform.', 'I love love working in a visionary environment where people are constantly solving challenging technical problems.  I AM AI. I am good at creative tasks, able to deal with tight deadlines and to work as part of a team as well as individually to develop solution for complex problems. Come join and follow me!']
